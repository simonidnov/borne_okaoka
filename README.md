# NW.js Starter

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Aluxian/nwjs-starter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Aluxian/nwjs-starter?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a sample project to get you up and running with [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/).

If you need help, read my tutorial [here](http://blog.aluxian.com/how-to-create-a-cross-platform-desktop-app-with-nw-js/). This is a screenshot of the app that the tutorial guides you through, Klout:

## Features

* native notifications
* auto update
* gulp tasks to
  * build each release
  * sign the OS X app
  * pack
    * Windows: nsis installer
    * OSX: dmg
    * Linux: deb package
  * upload to GitHub
* remembers window position when closed
* customizable settings in the right-click menu
  * run as menu bar app
  * launch on OS startup
  * open links in the browser

What doesn't work:

* tray icon on linux
* rpm builds

Not done yet:
* Windows binary signing

## Pre-requisites

    # install gulp
    npm install -g gulp

    # install dependencies
    npm install

* **wine**: If you're on OS X/Linux and want to build for Windows, you need [Wine](http://winehq.org/) installed. Wine is required in order
to set the correct icon for the exe. If you don't have Wine, you can comment out the `winIco` field in `gulpfile`.
* **makensis**: Required by the `pack:win32` task in `gulpfile` to create the Windows installer.
* [**fpm**](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm): Required by the `pack:linux{32|64}:deb` tasks in `gulpfile` to create the Linux installers.

Quickly install this on OS X:

    brew install wine makensis
    sudo gem install fpm

## Build

### OS X: pack the app in a .dmg

    gulp pack:osx64

### Windows: create the installer

    gulp pack:win32

### Linux 32/64-bit: pack the app in a .deb

    gulp pack:linux{32|64}:deb

The output is in `./dist`. Take a look at `gulpfile.coffee` for additional tasks.

## Tips

Use the `--toolbar` parameter to quickly build the app with the toolbar on. E.g. `gulp build:win32 --toolbar`.

Use `gulp build:win32 --noicon` to quickly build the Windows app without the icon, which normally takes some seconds.

For OS X, use the `run:osx64` task to build the app and run it immediately.

Use these to create the .tiff images for the OS X menu bar:

    $ tiffutil -cathidpicheck icon_menubar.png icon_menubar@2x.png -out icon_menubar.tiff
    $ tiffutil -cathidpicheck icon_menubar_alert.png icon_menubar_alert@2x.png -out icon_menubar_alert.tiff
